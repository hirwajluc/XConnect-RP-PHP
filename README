Note: Our code examples come from integrators like you. We publish these examples to help you get started, but they are not necessarily complete or correct.

Status of this example as of 21/11/2016: Functional integration (connection and disconnection). Attention to the use of mt_rand in FranceConnect.class.php, which should be replaced by a call to the random_bytes function for more security.
